If you have any follow up questions about the challenges, want feedback, or a place to discuss general ideas about these topics you can join the ASCSN forum: [https://forum.ascsn.net/](https://forum.ascsn.net/t/nuclear-theory-challenges-space/126)

Take a look at the video tutorial on how to run the example in code spaces if you have never done that:
